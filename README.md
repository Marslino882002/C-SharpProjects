Title: Airport Management System

Introduction:
The Airport Management System is a software solution designed to streamline the operations of an airport. Leveraging the power of C# programming language and utilizing hashing techniques, this system aims to provide efficient management of airport-related data such as flights, passengers, and staff.

Key Features:

Data Management with Hashing:

The system employs hashing techniques to manage airport-related data efficiently. Hashing ensures quick access and retrieval of information by mapping keys to values, optimizing storage and retrieval operations.
Modular Class Structure:

The system is designed with a modular class structure comprising key entities such as Airport, Flight, Passenger, and Staff. Each class encapsulates relevant data and functionalities, promoting code organization and maintainability.
Airport Management:

Users can create, update, and delete airport records. Each airport record includes essential information such as name, location, and additional properties as required.
Flight Management:

The system facilitates the management of flights, enabling users to create new flight entries, update existing ones, and remove outdated records. Each flight entry includes details such as flight number, destination, and other relevant attributes.
Passenger Management:

Passengers can be efficiently managed within the system, allowing users to add new passenger records, modify existing details, and remove outdated entries. Passenger records typically include passenger name, passport number, and other pertinent information.
Staff Management:

Airport staff information is easily handled by the system, enabling users to maintain staff records, update roles or personal details, and remove staff members as necessary. Staff records encompass attributes such as staff name, role, and additional relevant data.
Implementation Details:

Hash Table Implementation:

The core data management component of the system is implemented using a hash table data structure. This data structure efficiently organizes airport-related data by utilizing hashing functions to map keys to corresponding values, facilitating rapid data retrieval and manipulation.
Object-Oriented Approach:

The system adopts an object-oriented approach to software design, utilizing classes to encapsulate data and functionality related to airports, flights, passengers, and staff. This approach enhances code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
Hashing Function Customization:

The system allows for customization of the hashing function, enabling users to adapt the hashing algorithm to suit specific requirements and optimize performance based on the size and nature of the dataset.
Conclusion:

The Airport Management System represents a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing airport operations through robust data management capabilities and a user-friendly interface. By leveraging hashing techniques and adhering to sound software engineering principles, the system offers a reliable and scalable platform for optimizing airport management processes, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and passenger experience.
